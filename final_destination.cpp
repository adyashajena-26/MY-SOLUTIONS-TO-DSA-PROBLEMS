3.Final Destination
Consider a 2d plane and a Robot which is located at (0,0) who can move only one unit step at a time in any direction i.e. if its initial position is (x,y), he can go to positions (x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1) or (x, y - 1). Now Given three integers a,b (denoting the final position where the robot has to reach), and x. Find out if the Robot can reach the final position in exactly x steps.
Example 1:
Input:
a = 5, b = 5, x = 11
Output:
0
Explanation:
No matter how the Robot moves,
the Robot won't be able to reach
point (5,5) in exactly 11 moves.
Example 2:
Input:
a = 10, b = 15, x = 25
Output:
1
Explanation:
The Robot can move 10 times towards
positive x-axis and then 15 times
towards positive y-axis to reach (10,15).

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function canReach() which takes 3 Integers a,b and x as input and returns the answer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
-109 <= a,b <= 109
1 <= x <= 2*109
